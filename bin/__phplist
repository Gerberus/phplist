# script to run phpList from commandline. You may need to edit this to make it work
# with your shell environment. The following should work for Bash on Linux
# but this may vary strongly in other situations. You will need to dig into the
# code to make sure it works for you.

# in commandline mode, access is restricted to users who are listed in the config file
# check README.commandline for more info
#
# when you set this file up, and place it in your PATH, you can do eg
#  $ phplist -pprocessqueue
# to run the queue

# run the phpList index file with all parameters passed to this script
# make sure the php binary is "cli"
